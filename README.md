What the project does?
The project aim  is to create a menu for a cafe listing the items the cafe is going to sell. The menu will include various categories of food and beverages available for customers to order.
Each item will be listed with its name, description and price. The menu will provide customers with comprehensive overview of the cafe's offerings allowing the customers to make informed choice when selecting their orders. 
Additionally, the menu can be updated periodically to reflect seasonal specials, new additions or changes in pricing.
